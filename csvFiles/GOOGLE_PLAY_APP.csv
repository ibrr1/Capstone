One limit may be left empty to create an alarm with a single trigger.* Price Change - Triggered when price changes more than X amount (in currency or percentage) in a specified time frame (e.g. 15 min). It uses a rolling time frame: price is fetched with a given update interval (e.g. 30 s) and compared with the price fetched one time frame ago (e.g. 15 min ago).Sound and vibration are configurable globally, and individually for each alarm. Lists of exchanges, pairs and alarms are fully searchable, allowing quick setup and configuration. The alarm list behaves as your ticker, where you can reorder your alarms and directly change their limits. Triggered alarms ring, displaying their status, until you turn them off. Just like an alarm clock. Alarms can also be set to snooze automatically on price retrace. Market data is retrieved directly from the exchanges via Wi-Fi or Mobile Data (if allowed).Boilr supports all exchanges available on libdynticker, as all their pairs: https://github.com/drpout/libdynticker/#supported-exchangesBoilr is free (as in freedom) software released under GPLv3+.

The design goals for the app were big buttons that are easy to reach and the ability to get to the home screen when necessary.Documentation at http://www.purplefoto.com/PurpleDock works in both Portrait and Landscape orientation and has been tested with a variety of phones running Android 2.2 (Froyo), 2.3.x (Gingerbread), and 4.0.x (Ice Cream Sandwich). It works when connected to power and disconnected. GPS usage is throttled when not connected to power in order to save battery life.PurpleDock allows customization of three of the launch buttons. The stickpin, headphones, and microphone buttons are pre-assigned to Google Places, Google Music, and Voice Search. To override these buttons, tap and hold for 1 second to bring up an editor. You will need to know the full name of the application and the name of the Activity to launch. If you&#39;re running CyanogenMod or a ROM without Google Apps, you may find that the default button values for Music and Places may require some adjustment as these apps aren&#39;t present on many aftermarket ROMs.Is PurpleDock better than your OEM app?

This is just a technical analysis tool for scanning NFC-enabled EMV Smartcards, issued in Austria.This is not a payment app!Infos:----------------------------------This app tries to read free accessible informations (and if found) the last debit transactions from Austrian (and maybe other) Maestro debit cards (in Austria called &quot;Bankomatkarte&quot;).Of course works only with NFC-enabled cards (these cards often have the &quot;pay pass&quot; logo or the NFC logo printed on them).At the moment this app does not use the full EMV standard, so maybe it won&#39;t give much or any infos on cards from other banks. This app only uses reading commands, so no harm should be done to your card.But I do not assume any liability for errors or losses of any kind!

Your passwords are always available when you need them, but they are never stored anywhere!Keeping up with todays password requirements isnâ€™t easy. On the one hand, you want to have different, hard-to-guess passwords for each website and service. On the other hand, itâ€™s hard to remember so many passwords! You can rely on a web service to keep all your passwords, and make them readily available from any device. However, this creates a single point of failure: if this password service is compromised, all your passwords would be leaked!Twik works in a different way. You have to provide a private key that will be stored in the device, and think of a strong master key that will not be stored anywhere. Any time you need to generate a password for a website, you must type your master key. The combination of the master key, the private key, and the website will be used to generate a unique, strong password. Since passwords are generated each time, even if one of them is compromised the rest would be safe. Twik also integrates with any web browser, so that you can generate a password quickly by sharing a website with Twik from the browser.Twik is also available as a Chrome extension in the Chrome Web Store. You can use the same private and master keys to generate the same passwords on your desktop browser.Twik features include:- Several profiles, each with its own private key- Favicons to easily identify websites- Identicons to check that you typed your master key correctly at a glance- Share any website from a web browser to generate a password for it- Customize password generation for each website (password length and characters)- Automatically copy generated passwords to the clipboardLast but not least, Twik is open source (GPLv3).

If you don&#39;t have that, this won&#39;t be of much use unless you want to listen to music on your phone&#39;s awful speaker.â€¢ What are some recommended settings?The defaults that come with the application have been tested in the wild and have shown to work well. That said, everyone&#39;s tastes are different. We recommend choosing a slow and fast speed that aren&#39;t too far apart, because the effect is greater than you might think. Also, many phones get really quiet below a volume of 60, so pick volumes that are not too far apart.â€¢ This drains my battery!Yes, yes it does. Plug your phone into a charger while you drive.â€¢ Why does my phone seem to &quot;jump&quot; between volume levels?Unfortunately, this behavior shows up on many phones. We do our best to make volume changes smooth, but a lot of phones will only change the volume in increments of 5% or so.

89,69,btools.routingapp,BRouter Offline Navigation,"""Configurable, elevation-aware (bike-) Router for OFFLINE Navigation based on Open-Street-Map ( OSM)  Data. Works in conjunction with a (OSM-) Map Application, e.g. OsmAnd, Locus-Maps or Oruxmaps.See http://brouter.de/brouter for more documenationSee http://brouter.de/brouter-web for an online version.*** If you do not know one of OsmAnd, Locus-Maps or Oruxmaps, then the BRouter-App is useless for you. Download only if you are willing to spend some time to understand the setup. No one-star reviews from the unpatient please! email for problems ***BRouter does only the plain route-calculation and does not display a map or the calculated route on it&#39;s own and therefore works only together with a Map Application. There are two different methods for the interfacing between BRouter and the Map application: BRouter offers a service interface that is called by the map application without a need to start the BRouter-App. This way, BRouter is a routing service very much like an online routing service, including dynamic recalculations if you get off the track. The other mode of operation is to start the BRouter-App and use waypoints from the map application&#39;s waypoint database to define your route. The calculated route is then written as a GPX file (including the elevation profile) to the map-application&#39;s tracks directory. Locus and Oruxmaps and OsmAnd support both the service interface and the interface via the wayoint database in their current versions available on Google Play.The service interface uses a timeout of 60s, limiting it&#39;s use to distances of about 50km, but using the BRouter App you are able to calculate much longer distances. But even long-distance tracks can be followed via the service interface (including dynamic recalculations). This is done by pre-calculating a route for your destination once using the BRouter App and assigning it to a routing mode via the &quot;Server-Mode&quot; Button. This feature is called &quot;timeout-free recalculations&quot;. The route calculation, no matter if via the service interface or via the BRouter App, also considers nogo areas that can be defined as waypoints with a special naming convention (e.g. &quot;nogo200&quot;  for 200m radius). This way it is possible to account for actual obstacles, but this feature can also be used to enforce personal preferences.BRouter contains a download manager that assists downloading the required routing data files.The download manager is called on the first start of the app, and later on it is offered if internet access is available.The mapping from one of the 6 routing modes (car/bike/foot * fast/short), that are used traditionally by routing services, and BRouter&#39;s concept of fully configurable routing profiles get&#39;s the following default mapping after the installation of BRouter: car-fast -&gt; car-testcar-short -&gt; mopedbike-fast -&gt; fastbikebike-short -&gt; trekkingfoot-fast -&gt; shortestfoot-short -&gt; shortestThis mapping, however, can by changed anytime via the &quot;Server-Mode&quot; Button of the BRouter App. But also the routing profile definitions can be changed or new ones can be created.Routing for cars is is currently available only in an experimental state (&quot;car-test&quot;) and is not recommend. For example, turn-restriction are not taken into account.""",Maps &amp; Navigation,Dr. Arndt Brenschede,Everyone,2.3.3 and up,"100,000 - 500,000",1.4.8,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=btools.routingapp,625,4.1,1/7/2017 12:00:00 AM,636193440000000000,0,0

97,74,byrne.utilities.hashpass,HashPass,"""Hash Pass allows a user to input a password or any text and generate a hash from it. Generally a secure password is hard to remember so users tend to opt for easy to remember passwords. These passwords are also easy to crack. This app aims to address that by allowing the user to use hashes in place of their passwords on various sites.Example: a user may have a password such as &quot;computer&quot; (a bad one) that would be easily cracked in a dictionary attack.Where as the md5 hash generated from computer is df53ca268240ca76670c8566ee54568a which is not easy to guess or dictionary attack. There are currently four algorithms available in the app. MD5 , SHA1 , SHA256 &amp; SHA512. This allows the user to use the same password for four different sites and a different hash for each.For your banking or email you could use the SHA512 hash of your chosen password . In the computer example the hash is 922d076069b1df893fc010b7a6d2aa55c7c4c5d194f163394a4c864de5754131c17bfa94ac1667f56b5181cc7eca5dc3a09444caee6eecf16114926bb29f7e79The hashes are automatically copied to the clipboard for convenience. This allows you to easily paste it into an app.If a database is compromised which is insecurely storing the passwords and your passwords (your generated hash) was obtained . The other three sites (with different hashing algorithms) would be safe.Using hashes as passwords also makes an attack more computationally expensive as each string (sequence of characters) has to be hashed first before submitting it as the password. Also that factor is multiplied by 4 as the attacker does not know which algorithm you may have chosen.You could also paste the output of the initial hash as the input with different functions for more options. Just remember the algorithms and the order you chose if you do. This app respects users privacy and no data is recorded about the user.

111,864,com.secuso.privacyFriendlyCodeScanner,Privacy Friendly QR Scanner,"""QR Codes become more and more important. In some areas they have even replaced the traditional barcode. A QR Code is able to store up to seven thousand characters and therefore is qualified for more complex content, e.g. vCards.  Hence nowadays QR Codes can nowadays be found on nearly every advertisement poster and animate the user to scan it with his smartphone. Thus, it is no longer necessary take a  hand written note, it is enough to scan the QR Code. Correspondingly, there are already many QR Code scanner apps available in the Google Play Store.  It belongs to the Privacy Friendly Apps group developed by the research group SECUSO at Technische UniversitÃ¤t Darmstadt. More information can be found an secuso.org/pfaOur Privacy Friendly QR Scanner App differs with respect to two aspects: 1. The Privacy Friendly QR Scanner App only requires the minimum amount of permissions, namely:â€¢â€ƒIn category &quot;Camera/Microphone&quot;: CameraThe camera is used to scan QR Code.â€¢â€ƒIn category &quot;Other&quot;: Vibrate and FlashlightThe vibration is used to provide feedback if the scan was successful. The flashlight is used to support the camera in reading the QR Code successfully in bad lighting conditions.Most of the QR Code scanner apps available in the Google Play Store need several permissions on top of the ones needed: e.g. reading contacts or your call log and retrieving data from the Internet. Most of these requirements are not necessary for the functionality they actually are supposed to provide.2. The Privacy Friendly QR Scanner App supports its users in detecting malicious links: QR Codes provide new possibilities for an attacker, as QR Codes can contain malicious links, i.e. links to phishing webpages or webpages from which malware would automatically be downloaded. Therefore it is important to carefully check the link before accessing the corresponding webpage. Since it is difficult for the user to spot malicious links, the Privacy friendly QR Scanner App supports the user by highlighting the domain (e.g. in that case for https://www.secuso.org, secuso.org would be highlighted). To avoid not checking the link and in particular the highlighted domain carefully, the app provides information about possible fraud and its users need to confirm that they checked the link and it is trustworthy. Note, the information shown after scanning an URL based QR Code is not customized for every URL. Hence, it should be considered as an advice for the user how to behave in general.Similar to other available QR Code scanning apps, the Privacy Friendly QR Scanner App supports the following formats:â€¢â€ƒtextâ€¢â€ƒproduct codesâ€¢â€ƒphone numberâ€¢â€ƒsmsâ€¢â€ƒemail addressâ€¢â€ƒemail â€¢â€ƒcontact information (e.g. vCards)â€¢â€ƒURLâ€¢â€ƒWiFi (limited: cannot connect to network automatically)Bar codes are also supported.""",Tools,SECUSO Research Group,Everyone,4.2 and up,"5,000 - 10,000",1.6.1,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.secuso.privacyFriendlyCodeScanner,71,4.3,12/26/2016 12:00:00 AM,636183072000000000,0,0

Tap on that and select &quot;Choose input method&quot; from your notifications list.)FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS:Q: Isn&#39;t this an awful lot like that &quot;Gmail Tap&quot; April Fool&#39;s Day joke?A: It is quite similar, but it&#39;s no joke. This is a real, working on-screen keyboard which I&#39;ve been using full time on my cheapo phone since February 2012. Imagine my surprise when my personal software project was perfectly replicated two months later in Google&#39;s April Fool&#39;s Day video, right down to my rationale for designing it! I was planning to add a few more features before releasing it, but the video made me decide to publish this sparse but fully functional version ahead of schedule.Q: This is nothing like the setup I use for ham radio.A: No it isn&#39;t. Sorry! I&#39;d like to add some more ham-friendly features, such as audio feedback, and timing-based input using one paddle, two paddles, and/or iambic, but I haven&#39;t gotten there yet.Q: But really, why three buttons instead of just one?A: This was actually a design decision. Not only does my phone have a tiny screen, it also has a very slow CPU. I found that input methods based on drawing on screen (or other usage of timing) frequently screwed up when my phone&#39;s CPU would bog down. By having a separate button for dot, dash, and space, it doesn&#39;t matter how slow the phone processes things, as long as it eventually registers each screen tap in the correct sequence.Q: Can I switch back and forth between this and my original keyboard?A: Sure! Just go to your phone&#39;s &quot;Language &amp; keyboard&quot; screen and make sure both keyboards are ticked. Then, use the &quot;Choose input method&quot; option in your notifications menu. This will let you switch back and forth as much as you want.Q: Where did you get all those Morse code groups for punctuation marks?A: I made &#39;em up! See the Github page for this project, for more details.Q: Where can I report a bug?A: https://github.com/agwells/dotdash-keyboard-android/issuesQ: Are you sure this isn&#39;t a joke? It doesn&#39;t show up in my applications list.A: This is an &quot;Input Method&quot;, and so it doesn&#39;t show up in your applications list.

The charts can contain various information like sailing routes, navigation lights, dangerous areas, areas where it&#39;s allowed or not allowed to sail or dock, etc.All the professional sailors are obliged to have official nautical charts on their ships. These charts are published by authorized agencies and cost quite some money. Agencies are investing a lot in keeping the charts up to date. They release updates for the charts on regular basis, but because of the fact that reviewing the information and processing the updates takes quite some time the nautical charts are never completely up-to-date.Nautical charts of OsmAnd are based on the data from OpenSeaMap project. The idea of the project is to build the detailed map by people how actually use it. Every user of the map can contribute by adding changes to it making it more detailed and more accurate.While OpenSeaMap charts at the moment cannot compete with official nautical charts, they can be used by recreational sailors for orientation or route planning.""",Travel &amp; Local,OsmAnd,Everyone,2.3 and up,"100,000 - 500,000",1.0,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.osmand.nauticalPlugin,1380,4.1,12/27/2016 12:00:00 AM,636183936000000000,0,0

189,129,com.actisec.clipcaster,ClipCaster,"""[ Update: I no longer have time to continue to improve this app. Thanks to everybody who tried it out and improved awareness of this vulnerability! Improvements &amp; fixes are welcome via Github ][ LastPass update round 2: I automated the exploit for Facebook, as described in my blog post. If LastPass changes things up again it will stop working and may take a few days to get back up, but hopefully this time they will realise how ineffective this is and stop exposing their users to this vulnerability. ][ LastPass update: ClipCaster no longer automates the retrieval LastPass credentials. LastPass&#39; fill-in is still vulnerable though. For an explanation of why, and how to verify it yourself (some knowledge of JavaScript required), see my blog post at https://blog.xbc.nz/2014/12/lastpass-attempt-at-client-side-android.html ]ClipCaster is an open source proof of concept app that shows how any installed app can read passwords when they&#39;re used from password management applications.It can also be used as a tool to track the state of the clipboard, and to get a dump of the JavaScript LastPass uses for its Chrome Fill-In feature.Ars Technica article: http://ars.to/1vwcmT0Finds credentials when using RoboForm&#39;s &#39;fill-in&#39; feature for Chrome (Android version at least 4.3) and KeePassDroid.We do NOT store the passwords or send them anywhere; this app does not even have the Internet permission. The only place they are used is in the notification when they are sniffed.Now on the open source app store, F-Droid: https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdfilter=clipcaster&amp;fdid=com.actisec.clipcaster===Scope of ClipCaster===ClipCaster will automatically detect credentials when used from RoboForm filling out fields in Chrome (thanks to Robert for the tipoff) and KeePassDroid&#39;s copying notification.ClipCaster also has a clipboard history, collected while the app is switched on. Just hit the &#39;history&#39; icon on the main app. With this you can see what any app is doing with the clipboard.In the case of LastPass, it will also aid manual reproduction of the vulnerability by providing the JavaScript dump and the time it was generated. See https://blog.xbc.nz/2014/12/lastpass-attempt-at-client-side-android.html for an example===Scope of vulnerability===For all password managers: if it requires you pasting your credentials, it is vulnerable. If the manager has a built-in browser or keyboard, using that feature will almost definitely avoid the vulnerability. If the manager doesn&#39;t, type passwords manually to avoid the vulnerabilityFor LastPass: Even though it doesn&#39;t mention it, the &#39;fill-in&#39; feature (the one that pops up with credential choices, as in the screenshots) uses the clipboard and so is vulnerable. The alternatives are: the LastPass keyboard (or input method as they call it), the built-in browser, or using a mobile browser with a browser-specific LastPass extension such as Dolphin.If you&#39;re unsure whether a password manager&#39;s feature is vulnerable, ask the developers of the password manager.

All auto-replies can be logged in the application for future viewing and can be cleared when no longer needed.Custom Away Messages can be created to notify your recipient of why you are not available and when you can get back to them. You can make as many Away Messages as you want.  Messages are saved to your phone and can be set in Auto-Away&#39;s main application menu.Recipient Filtering allows you to filter who receives the auto-responses.  The three current filtering options are &quot;Just Contacts&quot;, &quot;Blacklisting&quot;, and &quot;Whitelisting&quot;.  Just Contacts will only reply to an individual, who&#39;s number appears in your Contact list.  Blacklisting will NOT respond to registered recipients on the Blacklist.  Whitelisting will ONLY respond to the registered recipients on the Whitelist.With Auto-Away you are in control of how a recipient views your messages.  With the &quot;Inform Recipient&quot; option, an [Auto-Away]: prefix will be added to your messages to let the individual know that what they are getting is an Away Message.For those who don&#39;t want the application to seem like a service, Response Delay will delay auto-responses for either 15 seconds, 30 seconds, 1 minute, 2 minutes, or 5 minutes to make responses seem more natural to their recipients.Repeat Responses is for when you really cannot be bothered.  You need your recipients to leave you alone and know that now is NOT the time.  With Repeat Responses enabled, if a recipient messages you multiple times while the app is running, it will respond as many times as they inquire.Auto-Away has become a FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) Application!

228,1704,net.usikkert.kouchat.android,KouChat,"""KouChat is an open source, serverless, LAN chat application for the desktop and Android.With KouChat you can chat and send files to other KouChat users on the same local area network. It&#39;s intended to be used on your wireless network at home, the coffee shop, work place or similar, and does not require any setup, Internet connection or servers to function. See http://www.kouchat.net/help/user-guide/android/ for more information about how to use KouChat.Notes:* KouChat does not see users across the Internet or the cellular network.* Some devices have unreliable network when the screen is off.* Not all networks have multicast enabled, which is a technology required for KouChat to work.* See at the bottom for tips if you are having problems.Any feedback, bug reports or feature requests you may have is welcome :)Features:* Group chat with all the connected users* Private chat with any user* Choose your own nick name* Set the topic of the group chat* Rich notifications* See who is currently writing* Send and receive files* Use away mode when you don&#39;t want to be disturbed* Choose the color to use for your own messages, and info messages* Send messages in any language supported by Unicode.Supported smileys:  :)  :(  :p  :D  ;)  :O  :@  :S  ;(  :$  8)KouChat is also available for Windows, Linux and Mac.Certain permissions are requested during installation. Here is a description of what they are used for:* Prevent device from sleeping - Needed by the WiFi lock, as well as the optional wake lock in the settings.* Modify or delete the contents of your SD card - Needed for file transfers.* Full network access - Needed for any kind of network communication. Only used between KouChat clients. No connection to the Internet is made.* View WiFi connections - Needed to be able to use the next permission.* Allow WiFi multicast reception - Needed because this is the kind of network communication used by the group chat.* Test access to protected storage - This is not requested directly, but is automatically added on Jelly Bean devices. It has no effect yet.Troubleshooting:1. Your devices are unable to find each otherSome devices just don&#39;t support multicast. I believe that&#39;s mostly an issue with old devices though.Also, some networks are configured to disallow multicast traffic. You might be able to activate multicast in your wireless access point settings if that&#39;s the case.2. You experience loss of messages between devicesTry enabling the wake lock to minimize message loss when your device is idle.Turning off &quot;WiFi optimization&quot; in the advanced WiFi settings can also help keep the loss to a minimum.3.

The tool basically emulates the behavior of the init.d kernel mechanism : it will detect whenever the device is rebooted and execute the scripts located in /system/etc/init.d.With this init.d support granting mechanism comes a kernel-sided init.d support detection mechanism, so that your int.d scripts don&#39;t get executed twice, which would only make for a longer boot time. Basically, when you run the test, it will generate a little init.d script which creates a file on your sdcard.

Currently, floating point numbers are supported for theMersenne Twister only. Three input modes are supported:1. Text field lets you enter the numbers directly on the device.2. File lets you choose a file with newline separated number strings.3. Socket opens a server socket on the device.  You can then connectwith a custom client by means of a client socket and send newlineseparated number strings to the server.  After each number the serverwill send back the next newline separated predictions.

Just get an empty writable NFC tag!* For bolding a word or sentence type (&quot; **bold** &quot;) (Note, you need space on both ends.## Markdownish Syntax:This is the supported syntax. Can&#39;t support full markdown, since this is only a lite hacky implementation. But kind handy for a no frills display that is easy to type on a mobile phone keypad.```# H1 only in first line (Due to technical hacks used)## H2 headers as usual## Styling*italic* **bold** ***bold_italic***## Classic List - list item 1 - list item 2## Nonstandard List Syntax- list item 1- list item 2## Block Quotes&gt; Quoted stuff## codeshere is inline `literal` codes.

Otherwise the rain will shortcircuit/kill the onboard NFC chip.* NFC tags placed on metal needs to be of the variety that supports sticking on metal.

This launcher is similar to old ADW Launcher Free before its major update in October 2012. This application is not currently in active development.

It is recommended that you do not set your common password in this application. Source code: https://github.com/chislon/LegacyLauncherFor help, take a look at the built-in &#39;Guide&#39;.

Note that some features have been removed, such as the hidden dock bar.)The original ADW Launcher was developed by Anderweb and a team of developers:http://jbthemes.com/anderweb/category/adwlauncher/http://code.google.com/p/adw-launcher-android/https://github.com/CyanogenMod/android_packages_apps_ADWLauncher# PermissionsThese permissions were retained from the original ADW source code and have not been significantly changed, and are standard for Launcher applications. # NotesIf your installed ADW Theme looks weird, make sure you have not selected &#39;Override Colors&#39; in the drawer and application tray. To have create the effect of hiding apps in the app tray, you can enable categories from the &#39;Launcher Settings&#39;. Then open the app tray, and hit the &#39;Menu&#39; button to bring up the category settings. Simply create one category with all the desired applications. Then you can return to &#39;Launcher Settings&#39; to turn off the &#39;all apps&#39; category. If you would like to install a theme with a custom dock background, remember to unhide the dock background. If you have an extra high resolution device, this launcher will not look optimized for your device. The original application was originally made for 800x480 screens and lower, so there is little I can do to make things work better for you since the graphical resources are raster image files. # Compatibility* Samsung Galaxy S Infuse has a different data layout on some stock firmwares.

Please, read carefully the description and if it is not what you are looking for, do not download it.If you are willing to help me translate the app to another language please send me an e-mail!Wi-Fi Matic is an Android app that activates and deactivates Wi-Fi of your device automatically depending on your location, helping you to save battery and consumption of data through your operator network.It detects automatically the location of known Wi-Fi networks (home, office, gym etc.), turns on Wi-Fi when you arrive a place where there is Wi-Fi, and turns it off when you leave that place.After some training (*), the app should learn all your commonly used Wi-Fi access points, allow your device to use Wi-Fi in the usual places and keep Wi-Fi off where it is not needed.â˜… How does it work?It DOES NOT USE GPS nor Android network location services, as it uses your operator network cell identifiers (cell tower identifiers) as the relative location where you are, and where your Wi-Fi networks are. It is designed to minimize usage of resources and battery. Wi-Fi Matic detects and learns automatically locations where you are connected to a Wi-Fi, not needing much configuration. It also allows you to manage manually your Wi-Fi when needed not interfering with you or with your device data connections.â˜… How is it used?1.- Run the app and click on &quot;Enable Wi-Fi Matic&quot;.2.- If you want to connect to a Wi-Fi for the first time, do it as usual in the Android Wireless networks settings menu. If you want to connect to a Wi-Fi you have already connected to before, just turn on Wi-Fi manually and let Android establish connection.3.- And that&#39;s all: Wi-Fi Matic will learn your Wi-Fi location when you get connected. Whenever you leave that place, Wi-Fi will be automatically turned off and whenever you get back, Wi-Fi will be automatically turned on (*)(*) Depending on your mobile carrier network configuration and your access point signal strength, Wi-Fi Matic might need some time to precisely learn all needed cell tower identifiers and work accurately.

(If your device has an active stylus, like the Galaxy Note or HTC Flyer, the true stylus pressure will be used instead.)Multitouch painting: Two fingers make two lines, three make three, and so on, up to the limits of your device (typically 5 simultaneous touches for phones and 10 for tablets).Kid-friendly interface: Every pen size and color is on-screen; multitouch drawing means accidental touches (such as kid hands on the edges of the display) won&#39;t prevent any little fingers from painting.Plays well with others: Share your drawings to other apps, and share images into Markers to draw on top of them.[New in 1.2] Pan and zoom: By far the #1 most requested Markers feature!

You can have strong device encryption password (which you only need to enter once after booting your device) but simple pattern/PIN/password for unlocking your screen.If attacker tries to guess your simple pattern/PIN/password, he has only few tries (default is 3) after which the device is rebooted and he needs to enter your strong device encryption password again.Why is it needed:Android always sets device encryption password same as screen unlock pattern/PIN/password. This is very unfortunate, because you should have encryption password as strong as possible, but nobody wants to enter long password all the time just to unlock screen.There is Android issue #29468 requesting different passwords for encryption and screen lock, but it seems to be ignored by Google (it is there from 2012 and recently marked Obsolete by Google).How to use it:After installation, start SnooperStopper and grant it superuser permissions. Then enable device admin in app, which allows SnooperStopper to monitor failed screen unlock attempts and reboot device if maximum number is exceeded.Whenever you change your screen unlock pattern/PIN/password, Android also changes your device encryption password, so you have to set your strong encryption password again. SnooperStopper automatically opens window where you can change it right after you change your screen unlock pattern/PIN/password, so you should never forget about it.Requirements:You must have enabled device encryption (Settings â†’ Security â†’ Encrypt phone) and your device has to be rooted (Android doesn&#39;t allow apps to change device encryption password or reboot your device without root access).Credits:Whole device encryption password changing code is taken from Nikolay Elenkov&#39;s Cryptfs Password Manager.""",Tools,Michal KÅ™enek,Everyone,4.1 and up,"500 - 1,000",1.3,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cz.eutopia.snooperstopper,15,4.3,3/20/2016 12:00:00 AM,635940288000000000,0,0

I occasionally want to encrypt word documents but can&#39;t find a way.- some produced by major software companies are simply bloated and litters temp files everywhere...

When triggered, it will sends alerts every 5 minutes with your location. Anyone in the world who is concerned about facing risk because of their human rights work can use the Panic Button alert application on their Android phone.     â†’ Panic Button sends alerts automatically every 5 minutes  Once Panic Button is triggered, it will send alerts every 5 minutes to your contacts to keep them informed about your location.     â†’ Panic Button alerts can only be deactivated with a Pin code   To prevent deactivation by someone else, you will need to enter your chosen pin code to deactivate the automatic sending of the alert every 5 minutes.  Panic Button can only facilitate emergency assistance when a user&#39;s contacts are in a position to act. The disguise delays the discovery of the application for as long as possible so that the app can send location updates to their chosen contacts. However, this does not prevent a competent adversary from accessing the content or recipient of the message through the network operator. Users are encouraged to visit our help pages to understand more about the general security risks of using their mobile phone.  Thanks to all who have participated in the beta so far. At least 25% of you have reported important problems and this is really helpful during the beta phase, in order to allow us to improve Panic Button:      a/ Accidental Alert Triggering: Unwanted triggering of the alert has cost money and caused worries. Weâ€™re really sorry for this. Sometimes answering a call is triggering the alert, but it also seems that when devices have covers that turn the phone on automatically, it can lead to triggering the alert as well. We are looking into the problem and which devices it appears on (it seems that mostly Samsung Galaxy models, Google Nexus 5 and HTC Evo have been affected).       b/ Cannot Trigger: On the other end for some, the alert couldnâ€™t be activated. It seems the issue concerns users with Android 2.3. We are looking into the issue as well.      c/ Stopping the Alert: Many of you couldnâ€™t stop the alert when it was triggered (voluntarily or accidentally). This app, when activated, will send messages every 5 minutes, thus incurring SMS costs. The installation wizard also could better explain that the procedure to unlock the disguise - opening the calculator disguise, long press on a calculator button, PIN entry - is needed to deactivate the alert. This is a security feature, but we realise it should be better explained in the app.      d/ Continues Alerting after Phone Restarts: Panic Button will also continue sending messages even if you turn the phone on and off. This is an intended feature (as if you are arrested and your phone is turned off by the people arresting you, we want to make sure that your location or message will be sent when and if they turn it on again).   To turn off the Panic Button please follow these steps:    â†’ Open the application (It should be called &quot;Calculate!&quot;)  â†’ A calculator should appear.  â†’ Click and hold any button of the Calculator (for instance 5) for 5 seconds.  â†’ Enter your secret PIN (which you chose during the setup). Then click on &quot;Stop the Alert&quot;. That&#39;s it! Now your  phone should stop sending the SMSes.If you run into further problems while we are still in Beta phase, you can then uninstall the application in the following manner:  â†’ Go to the Settings menu  â†’ Go to the Apps or Application menu.  â†’ Here go to the Installed Apps tab  â†’ You should see Calculate! here (or Panic Button).

Further improvements are adding voice messages, memos to photos.Easy LoginLog into the app LabCam Either with your username and password or by scanning your QR code. The Code contains Informationen Ã¼ber die personal account and the Collection ID. THEREFORE you have to sign into the imeji platform you want to work with and scan the QR code of the collection with your mobile device.Manual and Automatic UploadThere are two different ways for uploading your data: manual and automatic. The user can select and upload any pictures to selected collection. In contrast, the automatic upload is for large quantities of data. By enabling automatic upload function, any picture taken afterwards will be automatically uploaded to the collection did user has specified.Metadata profilesEach collection has a metadata profile by default, Which Could contain information: such as text, location, notes. On demand, user can therefore add / delete entries in metadata profiles. By uploading, LabCam will acquire all fields in the metadata profile and submit them alongwith the picture to the collection. This is Specially useful if user wants to collect information Directly from pictures.OCR FunctionAfter a picture is taken, to integrated OCR function will Recognise possible text, bar codes and save them as an entry in Metadata. This information therefore will be uploaded to collection alongwith picture.* In order to use LabCam app you need to create an account on the gluon. Registration is open for everyone.

In order to view a bookmark, you need to have a suitable maps application installed  as well (e.g. Google Maps or OSMAnd~).

On a recently booted device, it may be nescessary to initialize the location service with a more patient location tracking app.Bookmarks are color coded.

A red symbol indicates that the &quot;last known position&quot; was used and the bookmark should be double checked.NOTE: By design, the user interface is kept minimal.

638,1197,de.onyxbits.textfiction,Text Fiction - Playable Novels,"""SYNOPSIS: TextFiction - An interpreter for interactive fiction stories (aka: terp, z-machine, text adventure engine, interactive book reader)DESCRIPTION:West of HouseThis is an open field west of a white house, with a boardedfront door. There is a small mailbox here. A rubber mat saying &#39;Welcome toZork!&#39; lies by the door.What next? &gt;_With interactive fiction novels you&#39;re more than just a passive book reader, following the adventures of the hero. Instead, you become the hero! Explore the world, make decissions and ultimately decide on the outcome. IF stories are fun for hours, immersive as hell and play at your own pace, making them the ideal pass time for a long road trip and short work breaks alike.TextFiction is definitely the best adaptation of the genre available for Android. You control the protagonist through a novel SMS like interface which replaces the need for typing commands with intuitive touch controls. Users of chat apps will instantly feel at home! The barrier-free design also makes this app the perfect choice for users with disabilities.Hundreds of free RPG stories from dozens of literature genres (sci-fi, fantasy, mystery,... ) are available for download, ensuring entertainment for months to come. You can&#39;t get more offline games for free in one single app!FEATURES:* Supports z3, z5 and z8 z-machine games (may be wrapped in zblorb), no glulx* Unique, instant messanger like user interface* Configurable action keys to cut down on typing (long press to modify).  * Tap words in the story to copy them into the commandline. Double tap to clear.* Nightmode and classic Terp mode (&quot;Lucy&quot;, &quot;Mina&quot; and &quot;Jason&quot; colorscheme)  * Optionally uses the Text To Spech engine to read stories out loud (long touch a bubble to start/stop narration).* Touch sensitive borders/corners for moving in the designated cardinal direction (may be fiddly on small screens).* Saving/restoring progress (including autosave when navigating away from the app)* A real battery saver due to low power consumption and no ads (TextFiction is one of the few games that don&#39;t need wifi).FAQ (please don&#39;t abuse the reviews as a support forum!):Q: I&#39;m new. What&#39;s an interactive story?A: Have you ever read a novel and longed for taking part in the plot yourself? Interactive stories allow you to do exactly that. Textfiction is like a fanfiction reader (a library app for free books) that only describes to you the setting, but allows you to choose your own actions, often resolving in alternative endings.Q: Are the games free?A: Textfiction itself free to play. Most of the interactive novels are in the public domain and may be downloaded free of charge to your library.Q: How do I save/restore a game?A: Press the &quot;Plus&quot; button to bring up the menu. Save/restore commands won&#39;t work.Q: Do I loose my progress when going back to the libary app?A: No! Whenever you leave the story screen, the game performs an auto save. It does not, however, perform an autorestore when you return (leaving the game is suppose to be a reset).Q: Why is the story output erased when I restore a game?A: When you restore a game, you move to another part of the story. The current chat history no longer applies and gets discarded to avoid confusion.Q: Can I change the action buttons?A: Yes! just write something in the commandline, then long press a button to modify it.Q: Can I write my own fanfiction stories?A: Yes! The authoring tool of choice can be found here: http://inform7.comQ: Why does my bluetooth keyboard repeat the enter key?A: Text Fiction comes free of charge. Unfortunately, this means no budget for buying troublesome hardware in order to check the problem out.Q: Will a 1* rating convince you to change the app according to my whims?A: Go kiss a Grue""",Role Playing,Onyxbits,Everyone,2.3 and up,"50,000 - 100,000",2.6,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.onyxbits.textfiction,1923,4.1,9/17/2014 12:00:00 AM,635465088000000000,0,0

Try to place as many tiles on the board as possible, keeping in mind only two simple rules: your tiles must touch a corner of one of your previously placed tiles, but they must not share an edge. Can you play more tiles than your opponents? RULES:Each player has 21 Tetris-like tiles: 12 tiles with 5 squares, 5 tiles with 4 squares, 2 tiles with 3 squares, 1 tile with 2 squares and 1 tile with 1 square. Players take turns in placing one tile onto the 20x20 board. The first tile for each player has to be placed in their corner of the board. Each following tile has to touch a corner of one of your previous tiles, but it must never share an edge. It may share edges with the opponents&#39; tiles though. If a player has no more possible move, they have to pass. The game is over when no player can place a tile. For each player, the squares of all their tiles on the board are added up. Finishing a game with all stones placed on the board gives a 15 points bonus. If the monomino is placed last, you will get a 20 points bonus. The player with the most points  wins. HOW TO PLAY:â€¢â€ƒ Swipe the list of available tiles with your finger. â€¢â€ƒ Select and drag a tile onto the board. â€¢â€ƒ Rotate the stone using one of the 4 handles. â€¢â€ƒ To flip a stone, slide your finger from one handle toward the opposing handle.â€¢â€ƒ Place the tile in the desired position. The tile will appear green if the position is valid, and red otherwise. Possible corners are highlighted on the board for convenience. â€¢â€ƒ Tap the tile in a valid position to place it. â€¢â€ƒ You can rotate the board at any time to see the opponents&#39; tiles. Quit the app at any time, your current game will be saved and restored on next start. FEATURES:â€¢â€ƒ Supports 2-player modes, with 2 colors (Original and Blokus Duo), 4 colors (2 each).â€¢â€ƒ Customizable board sizes other than 20x20.â€¢â€ƒ Play against the computer or humans on the same device. â€¢â€ƒ Play online against your friendsâ€¢â€ƒ Hint and undo optionsâ€¢â€ƒ Leaderboards and Achievements (Google+ login required)â€¢â€ƒ Looks great on tablets, too!The game is network-compatible with Freebloks 3D for Windows and Linux: http://www.saschahlusiak.de/freebloks-3d/ PLEASE DONATE:Freebloks 3D is absolutely free, open source and without advertisement!

Dots are numbered left-to-right, top-to-bottom, starting with 1: 1    2    34    5    67    8    9This tool REQUIRES root access to work. If you are not using disk encryption this tool will not be useful to you. In fact, it will not even start on your device. *** WARNING ***If you forget the new password after you change it, you will not be able to boot  the device. You will have to perform a factory reset, DELETING all your data. Make sure you take a full backup before using this tool, and REMEMBER THE PASSWORD. You have been warned, use at your own risk! Android 3.0 (Honeycomb) introduced disk encryption and it has been available on all subsequent versions. It encrypts the data partition with a key protected by a user-selected password and requires entering the password in order to boot the device. However, Android uses the device unlock password or PIN as the device encryption password, and doesn&#39;t allow you to change them separately. This effectively forces you  to use a simple password, since you have to enter it each time you unlock your device, usually dozens of times a day. This tool allows you to change the encryption password to a more secure one, without affecting the screen unlock password/PIN. To change the device encryption password simply:  1. Enter the current password (initially the same as the unlock password/PIN) 2. Enter and confirm the new password 3. Hit &#39;Change password&#39;The changes take effect immediately, but you will only be required to enter the new password the next time you boot your device. Make sure you choose a good password, not based on a dictionary word, since automated tools can brute force a simple password in minutes. Above all, make sure you REMEMBER the new password. If you change the device unlock password/PIN, the encryption password will be automatically changed as well. You need to use this tool again to change it back, if required.

It is an issue with Android. Only way to fix this in Echo is to turn history off.FAQ0. Is it legal to record other people?      Good question. See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality_of_recording_by_civilians1. Why do you need these permissions?      RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED - start after phone reboot      WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE - save recorded wav to sdcard      RECORD_AUDIO - to record audio (of course!)2. How does it technically work?      - it uses some memory as a cyclic recording buffer      - when it records it just points sound processor to write to this memory and goes to sleep      - when sound processor is done, it wakes, points to a next part of memory and goes to sleep again      - it doesn&#39;t process sound in any way - no resampling, no compression, it just keeps the recording going      - once you want to save recording, the memory is saved to .wav file on sdcard.3. How does it affect battery life?      - it does affect battery less than a WiFi connection      - on my worn-out Nexus 4 it ran from 90% charge to 0% in 3 days - but other apps were also running and there was Wi-Fi and 3g turned on      - it highly depends on device and other applications - I suggest to test it yourself4. How much memory does this use?      1/16 of total device memory but not less than 5 minutes. It&#39;s usually from 6 to 24 minutes. If you have a 2GB of RAM, it will probably store around 25 minutes. You can increase this time up to three times in settings.5. Can it use flash memory to extend history?      It would make cpu write to flash memory. In theory it&#39;s possible but I didn&#39;t add this because it would reduce battery life.6. Can it use free memory to extend history?      On 4.0+ devices there is a way for apps to use all of free memory and release it when system is under pressure. This however would interfere with background apps (which usually live in unused memory) and it might cause loss of recording when a memory-intensive app starts. User-controlled memory usage would probably be best but clear and intuitive design is a problem here.KW: Microphone Recorder, Audio Recorder, Sound Recorder, Preventive, Mic., Rec., Record, Background Recorder, Voice Recorder, Best Recorder, PCM, PCM Recorder, 48kHz, Lecture Recorder, Silent Recorder, Invisible Recorder.""",Tools,Marek Rogalski,Unrated,Varies with device,"10,000 - 50,000",Varies with device,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.mrogalski.saidit,239,3.9,10/28/2014 12:00:00 AM,635500512000000000,0,0

Of course, in centuries past, societies didnâ€™t refer to this science as binaural beats, but what they did know was that consistent, rhythmic sound had extremely powerful healing and spiritual benefits.We developed this Binaural Beats app in 2010 after weâ€™ve learned about binaural beats and used them ourselves to solve sleeping issues due to the stress of our modern busy lives, something that most of us experience today unfortunately.Through the years weâ€™ve received amazing feedbacks from our users, which gives us the motivation and the energy to continue to improve the app. Check out all our reviews :-)Weâ€™ve developed different types of presets : sleep, meditation, focus &amp; attention, faster learning, pain reduction, creativity, anxiety reduction â€¦.It may take some time of practice to feel the effects of binaural beats so donâ€™t give up after your first try.We really recommend first time users to check out our Facebook (http://on.fb.me/lBDvPK) and Google+ (http://bit.ly/FBBTGP) communities. We have a manual which explains how to use the app (volume, headphones, ...) and describe the different BB presets.

You can support us by helping in the development, the design, the translation or you can donate through the app. Note this is the original free application, anything else on the market is a copy and could be a fraudulent version.We reply to review comments, you can also email any feedback (bbt@3i7.net) or use the Facebook or Google+ pagesThank you for your support !* A LITTLE MORE ABOUT BINAURAL BEATS &quot;Binaural Beats were discovered in 1839 by Heinrich Wilhelm Dove, and earned greater public awareness in the late 20th century based on claims that binaural beats help induce relaxation, meditation, creativity and other desirable mental states. The effect on the brainwaves depends on the difference in frequencies of each tone, for example, if 300 Hz was played in one ear and 310 in the other, then the Binaural beat would have a frequency of 10 Hz.You can find a more complete description on the dedicated wikipedia page (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binaural_beats).A few recent studies :Binaural beats and chronic pain : http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Zampi%20DD%5BAuthor%5D&amp;cauthor=true&amp;cauthor_uid=26773319Binaural beats and anxiety : http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11191043* SOCIAL MEDIA *Please join the facebook community at http://on.fb.me/lBDvPKForum on google plus: http://bit.ly/FBBTGPFollow us on Twitter #BinauralBeatAppOr read our blog (linked directly to the app) : https://binauralbeatstherapy.wordpress.com/* PHONE REQUIREMENTS *Now automatically pause and resume if a phone call arrives.This is why PHONE_STATE permissions are required.

If a neighbor is also a size three piece, it will also &quot;overflow&quot;.

However, you can add basic event management to it if you download the extension app (more on this below).VERSION 2.1.0 AVAILABLE NOW: Fixes to all visualization problems of 2.0.x and new handy font features.Notes for 1.9.0 widget users:â€¢ The layout was completely redesigned in version 2. There is only one size, not two variants as it used to be. For this reason you will see a message in your 1.9.0 widgets telling you must delete the instance and add a new one. This is inevitable, but don&#39;t worry, you won&#39;t lose any customization.â€¢ To get the same layout of the smaller widget (3x2): Just resize it down to that size, the text inside the widget will shrink accordingly. See this G+ post: https://plus.google.com/u/0/105780286835414277546/posts/JJgAAUropxMâ€¢ For those of you using the Calendar Events extension, you must update to its latest version. Former versions are incompatible with MCW 2.HOW TO USE ITThe calendar in this app is a home screen widget. Since widgets on Android work right on the home screen, you don&#39;t have to &quot;open&quot; this calendar: just go to the list of available widgets in your device, find MCW there and drop it to the screen.Remember you can resize it, and also put more than one widget on the screen.EXTENSIONSMCW is extensible. You can download additional apps that enhance the basic widget:â€¢ MCW Calendar Events extension: Lest you manage your calendar events right on the widgetâ€¢ More coming... You will find it here in the Play Store under &quot;More from developer&quot;.The extension is a paid app. If you find MCW useful please consider buying the extensions to support further development of these apps.

Someone included this app in a custom android build on your device or you installed it from a third-party-source and it isn&#39;t signed with my key, so there is no way you can update it.Q: When I switch to offline-mode, how do I know when the caching is done?A: There is no caching. The only difference to normal mode is that no connectivity is necessary and changes are stored locally. When switching to online again the spinning indicator should show while changes are uploaded. Caching occurs only when starting the app (everything except images) or the ImageCache is started (everything).Q: Why don&#39;t articles appear as &quot;read&quot; when I did read them on my PC?A: Most of the time this is no problem at all. But. There is simply no way to get this information from the Server-API. I have to guess how many articles could have been read since the last update of the local data and would probably transmit much more data then necessary in the end. So it *can* happen. But mostly it doesn&#39;t.Q: Quote from the comments: &quot;SSL doesn&#39;t work anymore -&gt; deinstall&quot;A: Yeah, deinstall. Don&#39;t want people like you around. Thanks. My fault.

You have to draw characters basically the official way.That said there are two forms of recognition: exact (you must enter the character with the correct stroke count, stroke order, and direction) and inexact (you must draw basically the correct strokes but can use any order and direction). If the inexact search doesn&#39;t find it, you can try searching for characters with 1 stroke more or fewer than you drew. This might sound complicated but the interface is easy; you get exact results straight away, if it&#39;s not there then hit the button and wait for inexact results (this takes several seconds, there&#39;s a progress bar), and if it&#39;s not there either, you can go onto the +/- 1 results.Notes:- If you&#39;ve drawn a character and the &#39;Done&#39; button is still greyed out, this is because it&#39;s still loading the data file. It usually only takes a few seconds, so please wait. This only happens the first time you draw a character after starting the app.- Some characters don&#39;t work very well if you draw them in the normal handwriting style. The data is based on print style. If you have difficulty getting a character recognised, try drawing it like the print version.This program is released under GNU Public License version 3.

All information is generally secured and hidden to the public, but you are able to enable and show this information to the public by changing the options in your profile settings on http://linuxcounter.netThe Linux Counter is started as a &quot;for fun&quot; project to find out how many Linux users there are worldwide. The basic idea is for people to register themselves as being a Linux user. Of course, this way you won&#39;t get all Linux users counted as not every Linux user will register himself at the Linux Counter site. Thus, the only way to &quot;know&quot; the number of Linux users worldwide, is to make a guess, preferably a not-too-wild guess of the number of Linux users. In not making wild guesses, there is only one way to go: statistics. So, the main purpose of the Linux Counter is to deal with statistics on all kinds of numbers related to Linux usage. It started with statistics on the number of Linux users and it extended to statistics on Linux users, the machines they use, software they use and in what part of the world Linux users are actually living.A second purpose of the Linux Counter is to make it possible for Linux users to find each other. The Linux Counter is reporting Linux users sorted per almost any place in the world. So, when Linux users want their information to be public, you can quite simply find those users who live in places near you.As of 2011 the original Linux Counter has been superseded by a new and re-written version http://linuxcounter.net by Alexander LÃ¶hner, which has since been Slashdotted and which uses the old, original database of counter.li.org.The old counter on counter.li.org has redirected for some months to linuxcounter.net, but now it was shut down.See also:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Counter""",Tools,The Linux Counter Project,Everyone,3.2 and up,"1,000 - 5,000",0.0.9,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.linuxcounter.lico_update_003,56,4.2,6/30/2015 12:00:00 AM,635712192000000000,0,0

Orbiting in space, far above the effects of Earth&#39;s atmosphere, it has opened new windows into our Solar System and Universe that were previously unknown.  Peering into the outermost reaches of our universe, it has inspired a myriad of new theories, experiments, proofs, and even more advanced instrumentation.  It has collected beams of light from unimaginably distant places for much longer than it was originally designed for, thanks to the indomitable courage and skill of NASA astronauts.  These facts and more lend to its immediately legendary status in the archives of Earth&#39;s history.The HST Images Feed Widget provides a home screen widget that displays images from the Hubble Space Telescope.  HST images are obtained from the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST) web feed.  There are three sizes of widget to choose from:  small, medium, and large.

GitHub is also a good place to file bugs or even to contribute, if you are interested.+ How to add a new radio station?The easiest way to add a new station is to search for streaming links and then choose Transistor as a your default handler for those file types. You can also tap the (+) symbol in the top bar and paste in streaming links directly. Please note: Transistor does not feature any kind of built-in search option.+ How to play back a radio station?Tap the big Play button ;).+ How to stop playback?Tap the big Stop button or unplug your headphones or swipe off the notification from the lockscreen.+ How to start the sleep timer?Tapping the Clock symbol starts a 15 minute countdown after which Transistor stops playback. An additional tap adds 15 minutes to the clock. Playback must be running to be able to activate the sleep timer.+ How to place a station shortcut on the Home screen?The option to place a shortcut for a station on the Home screen can be accessed from the station&#39;s three dots menu. A tap on a shortcut will open Transistor - playback will start immediately.+ How to rename or delete a station?The rename and delete options can be accessed both from the list of stations and from the now playing screen. Just tap on the three dots symbol. You can manage the list of stations also from a file browser (see next question).+ Where does Transistor store its stations?Transistor does not save its list of stations in a database. Instead it stores stations as m3u files on your device&#39;s external storage. Feel free to tinker with those files using the texteditor of your choice. The files are stored in /Android/data/org.y20k.transistor/files/Collection.+ How do I backup and transfer my radio stations?Transistor supports Android 6&#39;s Auto Backup feature. Radio stations are always backed up to your Google account and will be restored at reinstall. On devices running on older versions of Android you must manually save and restore the &quot;Collection&quot; folder.+ Why does Transistor not have any setting?There is nothing to be set ;). Transistor is a very simple app. Depending on your point of view &quot;simple&quot; is either great or lame.+ Which Permissions does Transistor need?Permission &quot;INSTALL_SHORTCUT&quot; and &quot;UNINSTALL_SHORTCUT&quot;This permission is needed to install and uninstall radio station shortcuts on the Android Home screen.Permission &quot;INTERNET&quot;Transistor streams radio stations over the internet.Permission &quot;READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE&quot;Transistor needs access to images, photos and documents to be able to customize radio station icons and to able to open locally saved playlist files.Permission &quot;VIBRATE&quot;Tapping and holding a radio station will toggle a tiny vibration.Permission &quot;WAKE_LOCK&quot;During Playback Transistor acquires a so called partial wake lock.

964,659,com.martinborjesson.o2xtouchlednotifications,LG Touch LED Notifications,"""This app will most likely require root!Update 16 May 2013: The app is no longer under active development. I&#39;m more than happy to continue update the app with code changes and translations through Pull Requests on GitHub or through e-mail, but will not personally implement new features or add support for more devices due to lack of time and interest.The source is available at https://github.com/mborjesson/LG-Optimus-2X-Black-NotificationsSimon told me that if the app is not enabled in accessibility settings, the app opens the settings after a dialog. But if you now click on an app to change permission, a new instance of the that settings screen will be started. This happens each time you click on the app&#39;s name. I don&#39;t know why, but if you leave your app and go manually to the settings, it works. (Home Screen &gt; System Settings &gt; Accessibility &gt; Accessibility Services &gt; LG Notifications &gt; Change from Off to On).If you have issues with rooting on P990 ICS ergosum told me that SuperUser does not behave correctly on ICS, and mein (from XDA-forums) found out that changing to SuperSU fixes this.There does not seem to be any fix for the Optimus Black 2.3.4-update, so a fix may not appear at all. Sorry about that. Still, if anyone have any idea about how to solve this issue please contact me.Touch LED NotificationsThis application uses the touch LED buttons to show if there is any missed notifications by turning them on and off. It is enabled by default and will autostart on boot but has to be run once after installation to start the service.Supported devices (this list is very outdated and may no longer be correct):* LG Optimus 2X/T-Mobile G2X/Star (P990/P999/SU660)* LG Optimus Black (P970) (not supported on official LG 2.3.4-update and newer)* LG Optimus 3D (P920)* LG Nitro (P930)* LG Optimus ME (P350)* LG Marquee (LS855)* LG Prada 3.0 (P940)* LG Optimus 4X (P880)* LG Optimus LTE2 (F160)* MT65XXOther phones might also work if they&#39;re similar to one of the supported devices. Even though a device is listed above your rate of success may vary depending on ROM and/or if you require root. It may also not work perfectly due to various limitations of the phone.If you get a message about rooting, you have to root your device to get LED notifications to work. This is not something I&#39;ve chosen to do, it is because the devices does not have the correct permissions and root is needed to correct them. If you wish to root your device you&#39;re doing so at your own risk.A note about Accessibility:The app uses Accessibility to listen to notifications from other apps. When activating this feature a warning will be displayed, this warning is part of the Android-system and is displayed for every app that uses Accessibility. The warning can safely be ignored as the app only uses the notification-part and since the app does not require an Internet-connection no data can be sent away somewhere.Some tips on how to increase the battery life when using the app:Every time the LEDs has to change or when the vibrator or sound is started the device has to wake up for a short moment. More wake-ups results in decreased battery life. So to improve this set the Touch LED mode to Constant and optionally use a lower Touch LED brightness, for example 15-25%, and do not use vibration or sounds. Devices that can handle one LED at a time will only use one to increase battery life.Thanks to everyone who has helped me out with the app during its development!Disclaimer: It is not known if using this app have any negative effect on the touch LEDs in the long term, so use at your own risk. By installing this you agree that I take no responsibility if anything happens to your device while using this app.If the latest version doesn&#39;t work then previous versions can be downloaded here: http://martinborjesson.com/android/""",Tools,Martin BÃ¶rjesson,Unrated,2.2 and up,"500,000 - 1,000,000",1.2.8,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.martinborjesson.o2xtouchlednotifications,3179,4,10/27/2013 12:00:00 AM,635184288000000000,0,0

LocationPrivacy is not really app but rather a set of &quot;privacy filters&quot; for all of the various ways of sharing location.  When you click on a location link in one app, LocationPrivacy offers itself as an option.  It then recognizes insecure methods of sharing location, and then converts them to the most private methods available.  For many links, the location can be read without even going online.  For others, LocationPrivacy reads the location from the webpage via Tor, so that it cannot be tracked to you. Whenever possible, the connection uses HTTPS.OsmAnd is the recommended map app for private location because it works fully offline and we have audited it.  LocationPrivacy will work with basically all map apps.

This has proven to be problematic because we cannot control the version of that component, and cannot upgrade it directly when bugs are found. In addition, Google has made it very difficult to effectively control the network proxy settings of all aspects of this component, making it difficult to guarantee that traffic will not leak on all devices and OS versions.Orweb also only provides a very limited amount of capability of Tor Browser, primarily related to reducing browser fingerprinting, minimizing disk writes, and cookie and history management.

1186,786,com.pierceholdings.dontpause,Don't Pause!,"""~Are you tired of Notifications interrupting your music?~~Easy to use~~Simple Customization~~Material Design Update~   Don&#39;t Pause was designed to keep your device from interrupting you when you are listening to music. If you are listening to music through your android phone and you get a text message or email, by default, Android pauses your music and plays the notification. Don&#39;t Pause fills in here. Don&#39;t Pause will run continuously once you start it and when you are playing music it automatically puts your notifications on vibrate. After you finish your music, Don&#39;t Pause automatically changes your setting back to the normal ringer. This app is similar to &quot;Shush!&quot; but I have taken it one step further. Instead of making you configure the app yourself, I have done the work for you. Go ahead and download Don&#39;t Pause and start it up. That is all you have to do to keep your mobile music uninterrupted.Thanks: - Latest Icon designed by graphic designer Franco Colomba.
